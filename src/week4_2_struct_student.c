 * Description:
 *   Demonstrates defining and using a struct in C.
 *   Define a 'Student' struct with name, id and grade, create two
 *   instances with the values from the instructions, and print them.
 *
 *   This program reads no input. Output must match the format in the
 *   Week 4 instructions exactly (it is checked by the autograder).
